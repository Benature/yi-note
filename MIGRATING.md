# YiNote browser extension migration guide

## From 0.6.4 to 1.0.0

For users who have already installed this extension in chrome browser, it will be updated automatically by the browser from v0.6.4 to v1.0.0. All bookmarks and notes will be migrated from the update.

**Note:** v1.0.0 removed unstable features like web article annotation and note sharing. This features will be redesigned and implemented in the near future, which also means webpage highlights data won't still be available in version 1.0.0.

Two backup files will be saved while extension updating. Please file issues in this repo if older version support is still needed.
